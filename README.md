Implementation in python of graph algorithms (*reference: Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition, Chapter VI*)
* **Dijkstra's Algorithm** (*additional reference: DPV Algorithms, Chapter 4.4*): Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths in any graph G = (V,E) whose edges lengths are positive numbers. The time complexity of the algorith is O((|V|+|E|)log|V|), when using a priority queue.
